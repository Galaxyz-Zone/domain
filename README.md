This is a responsive, image-based landing page showcasing various sections of Patek Philippe's watch collections, news, and distributors. The project features a slideshow-style layout and interactive navigation buttons, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Full-screen background image slider
- Smooth navigation between slides
- Call-to-action buttons linking to sections in a separate HTML page (indexz.html)
- Font Awesome icons for navigation
- Responsive design using external CSS

## Dependencies

- [Font Awesome 6.7.2](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/font-awesome) for icons
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Make sure all image and script files are placed correctly as shown above.
3. Open index.html in your web browser to view the landing page.
4. Ensure indexz.html exists and contains the anchor IDs (#footer, #home, #about, etc.) referenced by the buttons.

## Notes

- The index.html file must be in the root of your hosting directory (e.g., public_html/, or top-level in GitHub Pages) for proper root URL access.
- The <link rel="import"> tag was removed due to being deprecated.
- JavaScript should always be loaded with the <script> tag, not <link>.
